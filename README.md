# NYCU Introduction to Network Programming @ 2022 Fall

## About Lab8
Lab8 is a teamwork project, I and @nella17 worked together, but the files in this repo may not be up to date. 
If you are seeking the latest project files, please visit his repository.

I also made an unofficial scoreboard visualization server. The server may be unable to run due to the data source being missing, data pulled from the official scoreboard, which can only be accessed under NYCU's subnet, and the official scoreboard may shut down at any time.

## Lab10
Lab10 derived from lab8, so zstd and other files are required.
To simplify the repo, I've removed them from the folder, project is unable to build.
